The following is a description of the process of construction of a Decision Tree Model for prediction of breast cancer class. Further experimentation has been performed and documented to test some of the configuration settings provided by the KNIME component __Decision Tree Learner__. The breast cancer database used in this project was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. The project is mostly based on information from “Introduction to Data Mining” by Tan, Seteinback, and Kumar. Since this is an introductory project into the subject, some definitions are provided; however, it is advised to follow the references for detailed information.

For the most part, this is a introductory and exploratory project into the practice of Data Mining.

Review __2nd_Assignment.pdf__ for the full report of the project.

Best Regards,
